<b> 2020-06-01 to 2020-08-31 intership projects at Missouri S&T under Wenqing Hu (Missouri S&T) </b>

<i> Project 1. SNE (Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) </i>

Stochastic Neighbor Embedding via various optimization methods

to launch the algorithm, launch main.m
 
PCALearning.m, PCATest.m are used to perform the PCA
 
kNN.m, searchClass.m, Max.m are used to perform the k-NN algorithm
 
STORMoptimization.m is used to perform the SNE algorithm

<i> Project 2. Deep Learning </i>

Several commonly seen neural network structures for deep learning: ResNet, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network
